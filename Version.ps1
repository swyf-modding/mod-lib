    Version stamping, shared by the library and every mod built through it.

    Dot-source this and call Resolve-BuildVersion. A mod's build.ps1 resolves against its OWN
    repository and passes the result down, because this file lives in a submodule: run git here and
    you get mod-lib's tags, not the mod's.

        . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'vendor\ScamWYF.Modding.Core\Version.ps1')
        $buildArgs.BuildVersion = Resolve-BuildVersion -Path $PSScriptRoot

    Why this exists at all: the mod version used to be a "1.0.0" literal typed into [BepInPlugin]. It
    was correct on the first release and wrong on every release after it, because nothing connected it
    to a tag - and it was worse than merely untidy, since the launcher's Mods tab reads that exact
    string back out of the dll with Cecil and shows it to the player as the mod's version.

    Two output fields, because AssemblyVersion and AssemblyFileVersion must be numeric - the CLR
    rejects "1.0.0-beta.1" outright - so a prerelease tag keeps its numeric part there and carries the
    rest in AssemblyInformationalVersion, which is what Explorer displays.

    This is the same logic as the launcher's build.ps1, duplicated rather than shared because the two
    are separate repositories with no common dependency. Keep them in step.
