## Overview

**ScamWYF.Modding.Core** is an unofficial, community-built C# modding library for **Scam With Your
Friends**. It provides the things every BepInEx mod for this game ends up writing anyway: a base class,
a Harmony coordinator that reports collisions, one keyboard poller, range-checked settings, config hot
reload, and one in-game menu that all mods share.

**Key Features:**

- **One shared menu.** A single window on a single hotkey, with a tab per mod, drawn with UI Toolkit so
  it inherits the base game's own theme, fonts and scaling rather than imitating them
- **An in-game config editor.** A form generated from your `.cfg` file itself — bounded numbers become
  sliders, enums become dropdowns, and the descriptions you already wrote become the help text
- **Config hot reload.** A hand-edited `.cfg` takes effect while the game is running, including values
  that decide whether your patch is installed at all
- **Collisions made visible.** Two mods patching the same method, or binding the same key, is reported
  with both owners rather than being a mystery
- **No redistributed game DLLs, decompiled game source, telemetry, or credential collection**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The library builds to its own dll and mods **reference** it rather than embedding it. This is
> deliberate. The library owns singletons — the hotkey table, the menu, the panel — so when it was
> compiled into each mod, every mod had a private copy, and two mods meant two F1 bindings and two
> windows opening on top of each other.

> [!NOTE]
> BepInEx reads the config while the game runs, so the library **polls** for changes rather than using
> `FileSystemWatcher`. Managed stripping left only `Path` and `Created` on that type in this game
> build; polling notices a change within about half a second either way.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A legally installed copy of **Scam With Your Friends**, with the build listed under
  [Compatibility](#compatibility)
- [BepInEx 5.4.23.5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) installed, along with the corlib override —
  [Setup](https://github.com/swyf-modding/Setup) installs both, because this game ships a stripped `mscorlib` that BepInEx
  cannot start without
- The .NET SDK, for the behaviour tests only. Building does not need it

### Installation

1. Install BepInEx and the corlib override with [Setup](https://github.com/swyf-modding/Setup).
2. Add this repo as a submodule, so the library and the mods are pinned to the same commit:

   ```powershell
   git submodule add https://github.com/swyf-modding/mod-lib.git vendor/ScamWYF.Modding.Core
   ```

3. Build. `build.ps1` builds the library first, then your mod against the dll it just produced:

   ```powershell
   & ".\vendor\ScamWYF.Modding.Core\build.ps1" -Project YourMod -Sources ".\src"
   ```

4. Copy `YourMod.dll` into `BepInEx\plugins`.

The library is **not** installed into `plugins`. `BepInEx\core` is where it belongs, and `build.ps1`
puts it there — BepInEx loads `core` first so every mod can resolve it, and anything in `plugins` would
be loaded as though it were a plugin.

### Developer Setup

```powershell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/swyf-modding/mod-lib.git
cd mod-lib
.\build.ps1 -LibraryOnly          # does it compile
.\build.ps1 -LibraryOnly -Test    # does it compile, and do the tests pass
```

The library's own `build.ps1` needs the game's assemblies to compile against. It finds the install
itself; pass `-GameDir`, or set `SWYG_GAME_DIR`, if it cannot.

Start a mod from [`template/Plugin.cs`](template/Plugin.cs): rename the namespace and the guid, and you
have a working mod that already has a menu tab, settings and hot reload.

### Usage

```csharp
using BepInEx;
using ScamWYF.Modding.Core;

// PluginBuildInfo.Version is generated into obj\ by build.ps1 from your repo's git tag. See
// "Version Stamping" below - do not replace it with a literal.
[BepInPlugin(PluginGuid, "My Mod", PluginBuildInfo.Version)]
public sealed class Plugin : ScamMod
{
    private const string PluginGuid = "com.example.mymod";
    private const string BuiltAgainst = "6000.3.10f1";

    protected override void OnModLoad()
    {
        GameBuild.CheckUnityVersion(ModLog, ModId, BuiltAgainst);

        // Range-checked, and the description becomes help text on the generated settings form.
        var greetingLength = Settings.Bind("General", "GreetingLength", 24, 1, 200,
            "How long the greeting is.");

        // Pick up an edit to the .cfg while the game is running.
        WatchConfig();

        PatchCoordinator.TryPatch(this, typeof(SomeType), "SomeMethod", new[] { typeof(int) },
            "what this does", new HarmonyMethod(AccessTools.Method(typeof(Plugin), nameof(Prefix))));
    }

    protected override void OnConfigReloaded()
    {
        // The file was re-read, so re-derive anything clamped rather than trusting the old values.
        ModLog.LogInfo("Greeting length is now " + Settings.Int(greetingLength, 1, 200));
    }
}
```

Contributing a tab to the shared menu, if you want one beyond the automatic default:

```csharp
ModMenu.AddPage(this, "Status", page =>
{
    // The page host is already a scroll view. Do not add another: a nested one takes the wheel
    // first, which reads as a menu that has stopped responding.
    Widgets.FieldRow(page, "Endpoint", Config.BaseUrl.Value);

    var fold = Widgets.Section(page, "All settings", false);
    ConfigEditor.Build(Widgets.SectionBody(fold) ?? page);
});
```

The important part is what is *not* there: no `Awake`, no `Update`, no `OnGUI`, no window. `ScamMod`
seals the Unity callbacks and handles them once for every mod, so two mods cannot fight over them.

### Testing

```powershell
.\build.ps1 -LibraryOnly -Test
```

`-Test` does two things:

1. **Compiles [`tests/api`](tests/api)** together with the library against the game's own assemblies.
   That file is the public surface written out once, so every UI Toolkit and BepInEx call a mod is
   expected to make is checked against what actually shipped.
2. **Runs the behaviour tests**, each compiling the real source file it covers rather than a copy:

   | Suite | Covers |
   |---|---|
   | [`tests/watcher`](tests/watcher) | config polling, waiting for a write to settle, surviving a file that does not parse |
   | [`tests/window`](tests/window) | window size and position clamping: minimums, screen limits, idempotence |

The behaviour tests need the .NET SDK and are skipped with a warning if `dotnet` is not on `PATH`. They
use nothing but the BCL, so they run on Linux — which is what the CI workflow does on every push.

No game DLL belongs in this repository or in a GitHub release.

## Compatibility

| Component | Verified Version |
|---|---|
| Scam With Your Friends | `v82-playtest` |
| Unity | `6000.3.10f1` |
| BepInEx | `5.4.23.5`, Mono preloader |
| Doorstop | `4.5.0` |
| C# language level | `7.3` |
| Backend | Mono, with managed stripping **on** |
| Platform | Windows x64 |

Other game builds are untested. `GameBuild.CheckUnityVersion` reports a mismatch as a warning naming
both versions rather than assuming support.

The build compiles with `-nostdlib+` against **the game's own `mscorlib.dll`**, not a reference
assembly. The compiler therefore sees exactly the API surface Unity shipped, so a call that managed
stripping removed is a **build error** rather than a `MissingMethodException` in somebody's session.

---

## What the Library Provides

### `ScamMod` — the base class

Identity read from `[BepInPlugin]`, duplicate guids rejected, load failures logged and made inert
instead of taking the session down, and everything registered with the shared services undone on unload.

### `ModMenu` — one window, one hotkey, every mod

Press **F1**. One window with a tab strip: a tab per mod, plus **Mods** (what is loaded, what is
colliding) and **About** (this session, where the files are). A keyed tab mechanism lets the mod handler
take over **Plugins**. Rebuilding the strip keeps the current tab, so editing a setting does not throw
the user back to page one.

### `UiPanel` and `UiTheme` — the base game's own UI, not a lookalike

The shared panel clones the game's own `PanelSettings` and reads its live theme, so a mod window
inherits the game's theme, fonts and scaling. Windows are movable and resizable, and remember where
they were left in `scamwyf-modding.cfg`. The clamping rules that keep a window on screen and above a
minimum size live in [`src/ui/WindowGeometry.cs`](src/ui/WindowGeometry.cs) and are covered by tests.

### `ConfigEditor` — a settings form from your `.cfg`

Reads the `ConfigFile` you already have and draws it: booleans as toggles, bounded numbers as sliders,
enums as dropdowns, secrets as masked fields. Writes go straight to disk. Sections become collapsible
groups, because a config with fifty settings is unreadable as one flat list.

### `ConfigWatcher` — hot reload

Polls for mtime and length changes, debounces, and re-reads. Survives a file that does not parse by
reporting it rather than throwing out of the tick.

### `PatchCoordinator` — Harmony, with collisions made visible

One Harmony instance per mod. Target resolution that reports a game update rather than throwing, and
same-target patches reported with both owners.

### `Hotkeys` — one keyboard poller

One poller for all mods, duplicate bindings reported instead of silently misfiring, rebindable in game,
and suppressed while a text field has focus.

### `ModSettings` — range-checked config reads

These `.cfg` files get hand-edited, so a value out of range is clamped and reported rather than passed
on to a request path that will not survive it.

## Version Stamping

`Version.ps1` is dot-sourced by `build.ps1` and by each mod's own `build.ps1`. It reads the nearest git
tag and stamps the result into the assembly, so a released dll reports the tag it was cut from without
anyone editing a number in a source file.

| | |
|---|---|
| `AssemblyVersion`, `AssemblyFileVersion` | `1.2.3` — numeric, because the CLR rejects a prerelease here |
| `AssemblyInformationalVersion` | `1.2.3+g0a1b2c3` — what Explorer and Programs and Features show |
| `PluginBuildInfo.Version` | the same string, as a `const` a mod can pass to `[BepInPlugin]` |

A commit past the tag adds `+3.g0a1b2c3`, a prerelease tag keeps its name (`v1.2.3-rc1` →
`1.2.3-rc1+g0a1b2c3`), an uncommitted tree is marked `.dirty` and warned about, and an untagged tree
reports `0.0.0+untagged.g0a1b2c3` — which says so rather than claiming to be 1.0.0. The generated
`obj\BuildInfo.g.cs` is not committed.

**A mod resolves its own version and passes it down.** This file lives in a submodule, so resolving it
here would report *mod-lib's* tags rather than the mod's — the two are released independently and are
not always at the same commit. A mod therefore calls `Resolve-BuildVersion -Path $PSScriptRoot` and
hands the result to `build.ps1 -BuildVersion`.

Two fallbacks, so a build works outside a checkout: no `git` or no `.git\` warns and stamps `0.0.0`,
and `-Version` sets it outright for a source archive.

The reason this exists rather than a version literal in each mod: the launcher's Mods tab and this
library's Plugins tab both read the version back out of `[BepInPlugin]` with Cecil and show it to the
player. A hardcoded `"1.0.0"` is right on the first release and silently wrong on every one after it.

## Continuous Builds

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on every push and pull request, in two
tiers, because the build compiles against the game's assemblies and those are not ours to redistribute:

| Job | Runner | What |
|---|---|---|
| `tests` | hosted, any OS | the behaviour tests — pure BCL, no game |
| `build` | self-hosted with the game, or by hand | the real compile, the API surface check, an artefact |

`build` skips itself with a notice when there is no game rather than failing, so a green run never
quietly means "nothing was compiled". To use a labelled runner rather than any self-hosted machine, set
a repository variable:

```text
SWYM_RUNNER = self-hosted, windows, scamwyf
```

---

## Security

Please do not publish suspected vulnerabilities, credentials, authentication tickets, private game data,
or sensitive logs in a public issue — including the contents of `BepInEx\LogOutput.log`, which contains
the API keys mods configure.

The project deliberately does not redistribute proprietary assemblies: the game's own assemblies stay in
your install, and `vendor\` carries only what is ours to give away. Because this is game-mod software,
install only releases you trust.
